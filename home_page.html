        <p>Computer science is the study of computers, computational systems, and the processes that drive them. It involves both theoretical concepts, such as algorithms and data structures, and practical applications, like programming, software development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. By combining problem-solving, logic, and creativity, computer science enables the design of technologies that shape modern lifeâ€”from mobile apps and social networks to cloud computing and self-driving cars. As a rapidly evolving field, it plays a vital role in innovation and is essential to nearly every industry today.</p>
